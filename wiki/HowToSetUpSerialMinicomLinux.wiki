=== How to set up Minicom (Linux Serial app) ===

_This is primarily intended for communicating between your pc and the linksys headnode router, for the purpose of configuring and flashing it_

 * Open up a terminal window
 * type "sudo minicom -s" _(minicom -s is for setting up minicom)_
   * The sudo here is important - since we need administrative rights to set the default settings for the minicom

Now connect your serial (or usb --> serial) connection

 * Open a new terminal window
 * type "dmesg | grep tty" _(this command lists the devices)_
 * check for ttyUSB - in windows, serial ports are named com1, com4 etc. in linux they're named _tty_, and _ttyUSB_ for serial devices connected via USB

 * Now go back to the minicom
 * select "serial port setup"
 * change option A (device) to "/dev/ttyUSB0" (case sensitive!)
 * and make sure that both hardware & software flow control are set to "NO"
 * go back to main menu and select "save as dfl" (saves as default setting)
 * select "exit" - and minicom should now launch and you should see output from your device
