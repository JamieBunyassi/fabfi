This page will soon contain tools and tricks for managing your network installation.

= Node Mapping = 

Thanks to some help from Christiaan Adams of the Google Earth team, we have a nifty automated way of visualizing nodes in google maps or earth.  

There are two parts to the system:
 * [https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/fabfolk.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dFZoRm9zRUtkYktiNTU3NFhFU255Tnc6MA#gid=0 A Google form to enter node data]. Get a copy [https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/fabfolk.com/ccc?key=0Apnn7ogs3vm1dFVORHdaUnRQMWVCMXpIY3VMajExU1E&newcopy here].  
 * [https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/fabfolk.com/ccc?key=0Apnn7ogs3vm1dHNCX0tFVHZYTE1Qakc2LWxocWtOd3c&hl=en#gid=1 A special Google spreadsheet that makes map overlays]. Get a copy [https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/fabfolk.com/ccc?key=0Apnn7ogs3vm1dHNCX0tFVHZYTE1Qakc2LWxocWtOd3c&newcopy here].

Once you have your copies of both documents, fill in the red fields on the first sheet of the spreadsheet, then enter your node data with a form.  If you want to have pictures for your nodes, upload them to the web directory you specified in the spreadsheet with the name:
{{{
<node number>.jpg
}}}

When you're all done, the spreadsheet will give you a link to a Google map that you can post online [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=https:%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Fa%2Ffabfolk.com%2Fpub%3Fhl%3Den%26hl%3Den%26key%3D0Apnn7ogs3vm1dHNCX0tFVHZYTE1Qakc2LWxocWtOd3c%26output%3Dtxt%26gid%3D0%26range%3Dkml_output%26time1%3D4060933 like this] and a link to [https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/fabfolk.com/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Apnn7ogs3vm1dHNCX0tFVHZYTE1Qakc2LWxocWtOd3c&output=html&output=csv&gid=2&range=data_dump a list of placemark data].  If you use earth, it is also supposed to create KML [http://fabfi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/files/nodelist_netlink.kmz like this], but I've had trouble getting this feature to work in the linux version of Google Earth (the linked file was created in Windows)

= Monitoring with Cacti =

Cacti is an RRD based monitoring tool that uses SNMP and RRD to graph node data.
For a short tutorial on SNMP , go [IntroductionToSNMP here] - Links have been provided to more extensive tutorials.

A complete tutorial on how to use cacti and on other data input methods besides SNMP can be found [http://docs.cacti.net/manual:087:2_basics.0_principles_of_operation#basics here].

To install cacti on an ubuntu desktop/server computer :

`#sudo apt-get install cacti` 

This will require you to install php, Apache and rrdtool ( if you haven't installed them yet )

Access cacti from http://localhost/cacti/

Should you get a 404 error while trying to install cacti ( Ubuntu desktop ), add these lines to your `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default`

{{{
Alias /cacti /usr/share/cacti/site

<Directory /usr/share/cacti/site>
        Options +FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        order allow,deny
        allow from all

        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

        <IfModule mod_php5.c>
                php_flag magic_quotes_gpc Off
                php_flag short_open_tag On
                php_flag register_globals Off
                php_flag register_argc_argv On
                php_flag track_vars On
                # this setting is necessary for some locales
                php_value mbstring.func_overload 0
                php_value include_path .
        </IfModule>

        DirectoryIndex index.php
</Directory>
}}}

Access cacti from http://localhost/cacti/ or from another computer `http://<server-ip-address>/cacti/`
