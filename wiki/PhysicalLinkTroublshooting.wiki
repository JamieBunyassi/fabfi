A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Layer physical link] is just that: a physical connection between two devices.  Fabfi nodes have both wired and wireless physical links.  Choose the Section that applies to your link:

== Wired links ==

Wired links are made this ethernet cables.  Every device has a "link light" that lights up when the ethernet port has successfully negotiated a link over the cable.  The following images describe the locations of the link lights for each of the devices we use:

If the light is not on, you don't have a connection.  Check your cabling.

== Wireless Links ==

Wireless links are a little more complex than wired ones. Every link has:
 * A frequency band
 * A channel within the frequency band
 * A distance setting
 * An ESSID or BSSID
 * A mode: AP / STA / ADHOC
 * An encryption mode(psk2, none)
 * An encryption key (if encrypted)

In order for a link to function properly, all of these must be set correctly.  This should all be configured by default, but here are a few general rules to remember:

 * Devices must be in the same band
 * AP and STA devices must share an ESSID (called ssid in the config file)
 * ADHOC devices share a BSSID
 * Any two devices must share the same encryption key and mode
 * Any device where a channel is explicitly specified must share that channel with the other device it talks to
