#summary Evaluation summaries of packages, hardware, and processes under consideration in "the next version" of FabFi

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= What are the hallmarks of "the next version"? =
  * massively larger number of nodes and devices (order 1000 to 2000)
  * possible large load of rsync/mirror traffic among content servers in the mesh

= Software: Routing =
The order of magnitude increase in the number of devices ...
