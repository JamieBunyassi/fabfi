= Introduction =

This page explains how to build fabfi nodes.  While fabfi can run on many different types of hardware, there are essentially only two types of nodes: Common Nodes and Headnodes, as explained below 

== Headnode ==

Headnodes are the control nodes for the network.  They do useful stuff like resolving local URL aliases and communicating with the dashboard server.  They generally are also uplinks to the internet.  

== Common Nodes ==

Common nodes are all the other nodes in the network.  They may or may not have uplinks and may or may not directly service clients.  

= Device Support and Specfic Installation Instructions =

It's likely that the current version of Fabfi will run on any ar71xx platform device, but the devices we've used and tested are:
 * [LinksysWRT160NL Linksys WRT160NL]
 * [UbiquitiAR71xx Ubiquiti NanoM5-loco]
 * [UbiquitiAR71xx Ubiquiti NanoM2-loco]
 * [UbiquitiAR71xx Ubiquiti PicoM2-HP]
We have not tested any other platforms or devices at this time.  Click on the device above for detailed instructions
