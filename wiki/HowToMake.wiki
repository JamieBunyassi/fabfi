*Note: We STRONGLY recommend using linux for working with fabfi.  If you don't want to change your OS, run Ubuntu from a [http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download LiveCD].*

= Core Tasks =

The fabfi wireless system consists of three major components:

  * [FabfiServer Fabfi Server]
  * [FabfiNodes Fabfi Nodes]
    * [FabfiNodes#HeadNode Headnode]
    * [FabfiNodes#CommonNode Common Nodes]
  * [RFReflectors Fabfi Reflectors]

The Fabfi server runs in "the cloud", handles the authentication of clients and serves the stats page.

Common nodes make up the physical mesh network, with headnodes acting as local DNS servers and web caches. Any node can be an uplink to the internet.

Fabfi Reflectors are used to enhance the RF signal of wifi devices for long-range links.  

Administrators [UserAndGroupSettings configure Users and Groups] to control access to the network.  Authentication and user accounting is managed centrally on the Fabfi Server.

= Advanced Development =

In addition to the basic configuration instructions, we also have a section on Advanced Development that explains how to build images from scratch and perform other custom tasks:
