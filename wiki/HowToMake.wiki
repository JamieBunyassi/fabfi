The fabfi wireless system consists of three major components:

  * [FabfiServer Fabfi Server]
  * [FabfiNodes Fabfi Nodes]
    * [FabfiNodes#HeadNode Headnode]
    * [FabfiNodes#CommonNode Common Nodes]
  * [RFReflectors Fabfi Reflectors]

The Fabfi server runs in "the cloud", handles the authentication of clients and serves the stats page.

Common nodes make up the physical mesh network, with headnodes acting as local DNS servers and web caches. Any node can be an uplink to the internet.

Fabfi Reflectors are used to enhance the RF signal of wifi devices for long-range links.
