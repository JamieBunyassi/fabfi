= How it works = 

Running squid transparently (no special settings needed for clients) requires both the proxy program and a firewall rule to direct traffic to the proxy.  

From a troubleshooting perspective, the above is important because if squid turns off, all the web traffic is directed into a black hole.  

A classic example of this manifesting itself is when a user can log in to the system, but the content of the splash page is missing and users cannot browse to web pages.  

if squid is not running, first make sure your external drive is mounted by trying to enter the cache directory:
{{{
cd /home/squid
}}}
if this directory is not there (and you ran setup proerly), make sure your drive is inserted and reboot the device.  if this was the isue, squid should start automatically.  

If the drive mounts, but squid does not start, try to start it at the command line with:
{{{
$ squid -D
}}}
then look to see if squid is running by running 
{{{
ps
}}}
and looking for three processes:
{{{
squid -D
(squid -D)
(unlinkd)
}}}

Then check the log for squid error messages by running 
{{{
logread
}}}
you shouldn't see any errors here unless you have config file issues.
