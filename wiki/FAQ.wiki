== How should I size my ISP uplink? ==

The rule of thumb is to allow 100 kbps for each subscriber.  This would provide decent speeds suitable for streaming content.  

== How big can my mesh get? ==

The achilles heel (weak point) of meshes is that speeds are reduced with every hop.  If most of your mesh is 3 or more hops away from an uplink, consider adding a backbone through the mesh.  

== Sometimes you show a node with more than one radio frequency.  Are the radios dual band? ==

A "node" can refer to more than one piece of hardware or device.  All the devices together at a single site is usually termed a "node".  

The Ubiquity (Kenya) and Linksys (Jalalabad) devices are single band.  We use multiple devices together, sometimes termed "[back_to_back back to back]" to accomplish the multiple frequencies.  This is advisable in every case because a correctly
configured network of paired devices will have much better multi-hop
throughput.  With single devices, every hop will degrade throughput
down to a floor of 1/7 of single link capacity at 5-6 hops. Paired
devices that go `wireless` - `wire` -`wireless` on non-overlapping
channels will experience little or no degradation.

There are dual band radios such as from [OpenMesh http://www.open-mesh.com/index.php/enterprise-mesh.html]  which we have not tried but are eager to hear your experiences with.

== Is there a way to use a single channel or is everything set up to use non-overlapping channels? ==

You *could* use a single channel for everything, however this would have a significant impact on performance, particularly for multiple hops.
