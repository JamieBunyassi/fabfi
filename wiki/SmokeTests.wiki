#summary Results of basic functionality testing

= Introduction =

This page is an archive of all the key functionality tests we've done for fabfi 5.0, mainly so we don't forget and do them twice.  


== Wireless ==

All things pertaining to wireless configurations and performance

=== AP + ADHOC ===

Tested a single device with AP+ADHOC wireless configuration as follows: 

{{{
config 'wifi-device' 'radio0'
       option 'type' 'mac80211'
       option 'channel' '11'
       option 'macaddr' '68:7f:74:91:37:21'
       option 'hwmode' '11ng'
       option 'htmode' 'HT20'
       list 'ht_capab' 'SHORT-GI-40'
       list 'ht_capab' 'DSSS_CCK-40'
       option 'disabled' '0'

config 'wifi-iface'
       option 'device' 'radio0'
       option 'ssid' 'hideadhoc'
       option 'encryption' 'none'
       option 'network' 'wlan'
       option 'mode' 'adhoc'
       option hidden 1

config 'wifi-iface'
       option 'device' 'radio0'
       option 'ssid' 'AP-Openwrt'
       option 'encryption' 'none'
       option 'network' 'wlan2'
       option 'mode' 'ap'
}}}
This was built on a linksys wrt160nl (atheros 9xxx, compat-wireless 2011-06-22,   2.6.39.2 kernel, openwrt 27724)

Test setup: 
STA<-->AP/ADHOC<-->ADHOC

Interfaces loaded properly and iperf results were as follows:
 * AP/ADHOC<-->ADHOC: 24-25Mbps (whether or not client was connected had no effect)
 * STA<-- * -->ADHOC: 11Mbps
 * STA<-->AP/ADHOC: 28.6Mbps

The only failure exhibited was that hiding the ADHOC SSID had no effect (SSID still advertised)
