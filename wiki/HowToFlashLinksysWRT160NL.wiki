Note: currently, we are using "Linksys WRT160NL" as "head nodes" for the FabFi network

===How to Flash a Head Node:===

==Prerequisites==

*Hardware you will need:*
 * A serial cable (or, for most modern users, a usb --> serial connection)
 * A Linksys WRT160NL Router

*Software you will need:*
 * The latest image to be flashed
   * (This can either be built using openWRT and the latest SVN download, or by going __here__ to the downloads page to find the latest stable build)
 * A TFTP program
   * Linux: minicom (sudo apt-get tftp)
   * Windows: google for "how to enable windows tftp"
 * A Serial program
   * Linux: minicom (sudo apt-get minicom)
   * Windows: google for "windows serial alternatives" (we used "Tera Term" and it worked great)

Note: in our experiences, we found this all easier to do in linux, and even easier if you have both windows and linux. We were able to easily connect 


 # 

connect to the serial port

start minicom on your computer. make sure you've specified the serial port to which your router is connected

reboot the router

press any key at "Hit any key to stop the boot process"

enter the command "upgrade code.bin"

start tftp on a separate window.

tftp 192.168.1.1

tftp>binary

tftp>rexmt 1

tftp>trace on

tftp>put code.bin

Your router should show that it has received the code.

Wait until it indicates "done" on the serial console.
