#summary Unstalling USB modem on linksys wrt160nl

= Introduction =

This page details the steps for using various USB Modems with OpenWRT

= Basic Requirements =

All USB Modem applications will require (or at least won't be hurt by the following:

  # Install stock image
  # remove kmod-usb-ohci
  # install usbutils kmod-usb-serial kmod-usb2 kmod-usb-uhci usb-modeswitch usb-modeswitch-data comgt (auto-installed dependencies libusb zlib chat)

= Device Specific Instructions =

== ZTE AC 2726 ==

_Note: This device currently may require hotplugging between connections to work correctly.  I suspect we're missing some sore of reset in the disconnect commands_

Now your device should be recognised and have the correct device type (0xfff1 - read from lsusb)

NOTES:

on reboot, device is recognized after a while (I think).  In it's base state light blinks red. you have to manually switch it (usb_modeswitch /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/19d2\:fff5), then ifup wan works and turns light fast blinking green.
