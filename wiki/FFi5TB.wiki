#summary FabFi 5.0 Test Bed


= Overview =

The FabFi 5.0 Test Bed ... will come online in late August 2011.  (Tentatively in a working session held in Cape Town, South Africa).  

The purpose of the testbed is to implement and test in microcosm all the functional and architectural components of FF5.

Its permanent location is TBD.

= Node Configuration =


*T-Node:*
  * 1 - PowerAP-N (OpenWRT), serving clients @2.4G 
  * 1+ - !NanostationM5-Loco (AirOS), connecting to other T-Nodes
  * 1+ - !NanostationM5-Loco (AirOS), connecting to C-Node Mesh
  * Note: there is no easy all-PassivePOE solution for T-Nodes as !RouterStation Pros are 48V and !RouterStations Need more Switchports

T-Node Design Consideration: If Servers include wifi, PowerAP can talk to server wirelessly.

*C-Node:*
  * 1 - PowerAP-N (OpenWRT), serving clients AND adhoc mesh @2.4G NB: Assumes: AP+adhoc functional in OpenWRT *ANTOINE: TEST*
  * 1 - !NanostationM5-Loco (AirOS), connecting to T-Node
  * (option) 1 - !PicostationM2-HP (AirOS), connects to other C-Nodes in an adhoc mesh instead of radio reuse on PowerAP-N

= Proposed Architecture =

 * Core
  * 4 T-nodes
   * Primary uplink with content server and RADIUS master
   * Secondary uplink
   * Non-uplinked content server
   * Plain T-node
 * Local Mesh
  * 5 C-nodes
