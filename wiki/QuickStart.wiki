= System Overview =

Every Fabfi system consists of one or more _Head nodes,_ and zero or more _Common Nodes_.  The network access is controlled, and network performance monitored by  by a _management server_, which can either be installed locally or in any location on the public internet. For networks where IPv6 is not provided natively by the uplink, the network uses a _tunnel provider_ on the internet to obtain an IPv6 address.

This guide will walk you through the steps of:
 # Choosing wireless hardware
 # Registering for an account on the FabFi management server
 # Obtaining an IPv6 ip address
 # Flashing a Fabfi device
 # Configuring FabFi nodes
