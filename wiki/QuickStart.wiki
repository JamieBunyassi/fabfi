= System Overview =

Every Fabfi system consists of one or more _Head nodes,_ and one or more _Common Nodes_.  The network access is controlled, and network performance monitored, by  by a _management server_, which can either be installed locally or in any location on the public internet. For networks where IPv6 is not provided natively by the uplink, the network uses a _tunnel provider_ on the internet to obtain an IPv6 address.

This guide will walk you through the steps of:
 # Registering for an account on the FabFi management server
 # Obtaining an IPv6 ip address
 # Choosing a System Type
 # Flashing a FabFi device
 # Configuring FabFi nodes

=== Prepare your computer ===
This tutorial is designed for Ubuntu Linux.  If you do not have a computer running Ubuntu or another debian-based linux machine, we recommend you obtain one before proceeding.  If you do not have a computer that runs linux natively, you can boot Ubuntu from an installation CD or USB Stick as described on the [http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download Ubuntu download page].     

Once you have a linux computer, install _tftp_ and _minicom_ pachages:

{{{
sudo apt-get tftp minicom
}}}

If you are planning to work with the Linksys WRT160NL, you will also need an adapter to convert USB to CMOS-level serial, such as [http://www.makershed.com/FTDI_Friend_v1_0_p/mkad22.htm?1=1&CartID=0 this], some wire or a header to attach the converter to the router, and a usb cable to connect to your computer *TODO: Spec a Kit with all the right components*

=== Download and install firmware ===

The firmware image and installation procedure for each device is different.  Proceed by choosing your device:

 * Linksys WRT160NL
 * Ubiquiti RouterStation
 * Ubiquiti PicoStation and NanoStation-Loco
