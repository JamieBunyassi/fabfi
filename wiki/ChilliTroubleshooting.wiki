[http://coova.org/CoovaChilli Chilli] is the program that provides the captive portal for client logins to the system.  To start it requires a connection to the [http://freeradius.org/ RADIUS server].

If you're having trouble with client logins, it's likely a chilli problem.  Follow the troubleshooting procedure to figure out what's wrong.

Perform each test and follow the instructions based on the results.  

Most tests will require you to log in with ssh to the router that should be running chilli.  Go back to [TroubleShooting#Useful_Commands the commands section] in you need more info on SSH.
