It can be proved for a reasonably large number of  users, N (http://perso.rd.francetelecom.fr/bonald/Pub/itc18-dim.pdf) that: 

C = N/(1/a + 1/d - 1/c) 

where C is total uplink capacity,  a is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_hour Busy-hour] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offered_load offered load] (BHOL), d is useful capacity and c is offered per-user capacity.  

The FCC in the US [http://download.broadband.gov/plan/the-broadband-availability-gap-obi-technical-paper-no-1-chapter-4-network-economics.pdf recently estimated 160kbps for BHOL].  Knowing the speeds you are offering users (c) and the minimum speed you would like them to actually experience (d), you can then calculate the amount of bandwidth you need to serve them. using the equation
