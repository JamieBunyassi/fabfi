#summary An introduction to RRDTOOL and graphing

= Introduction =

RRDTOOL stands for Round Robin Database Tool. Unlike ordinary databases, a round robin database never grows in size - it simply writes over old data.

rrdtool is the successor to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Router_Traffic_Grapher MRTG] - the MultiRouter Traffic Grapher.

There are basically three things done with rrdtool :

  * Create a round robin database
  * Updating the round robin database
  * Graphing the information in the RRD database
 
== Creating a RRD database ==

This is done with the command

`rrdtool create`

for example 

`#rrdtool create "${1}" --step 60  \
DS:meshin:DERIVE:600:0:12500000 \
DS:meshout:DERIVE:600:0:12500000 \
DS:wifimeshin:DERIVE:600:0:12500000 \
DS:wifimeshout:DERIVE:600:0:12500000 \
DS:clientsin:DERIVE:600:0:12500000 \
DS:clientsout:DERIVE:600:0:12500000 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:60 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:5:288 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:60:168 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:300:150 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1440:365`

== Updating a RRD database ==

This is done with the command

`rrdtool update`

== Generating a graph ==

This is done with the command

`rrdtool graph`
