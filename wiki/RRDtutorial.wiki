#summary An introduction to RRDTOOL and graphing

= Introduction =

RRDTOOL stands for Round Robin Database Tool. Unlike ordinary databases, a round robin database never grows in size - it simply writes over old data.

rrdtool is the successor to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Router_Traffic_Grapher MRTG] - the MultiRouter Traffic Grapher.

There are basically three things done with rrdtool :

  * Create a round robin database
  * Updating the round robin database
  * Graphing the information in the RRD database
 
== Creating a RRD database ==

This is done with the command

`rrdtool create`

for example 

{{{
#rrdtool create meshdata.rrd --step 60  \
	DS:meshin:DERIVE:600:0:12500000 \
	DS:meshout:DERIVE:600:0:12500000 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:60 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:5:288 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:60:168 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:300:150 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1440:365
}}}

Where :

*meshdata.rrd* is the name of the rrd database we are creating

*--step 60* - means that the database is to be updated every 60 seconds - or rather, the rrd database expects data every 60 seconds

*DS* - stands for data source. In this example, we have two data sources : meshin and meshout

== Updating a RRD database ==

This is done with the command

`rrdtool update`

== Generating a graph ==

This is done with the command

`rrdtool graph`
