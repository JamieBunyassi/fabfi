#summary An introduction to RRD and graphing

= Introduction =

RRD stands for Round Robin Database. Unlike ordinary databases, a round robin database never grows in size - it simply writes over old data.

rrdtool is the successor to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Router_Traffic_Grapher MRTG] - the multirouter traffic grapher.  
 
rrdgraph is used to graph data stored in an rrd database
