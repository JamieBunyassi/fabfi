== Welcome to the [http://fabfi.fabfolk.com FabFi] Project ==

_NOTE: This Wiki is designed to help anyone with some computer experience to build a fabfi network.  As such, we deliberately build from base principles and provide additional explanations whenever possible.  We apologize if this is a little tedious for more advanced users._

*Navigate the system documentation using the menu on the left.*

If you're brand new to Linux (and we really suggest you use it), you might want to check out some ComputingBasics.

Want to know how everything fits together? Go to SystemArchitecture

If you want to make a Fabfi (or 100 of them) jump to HowToMake

If you're looking for troubleshooting support jump to TroubleShooting (this page also has a bunch of useful command line commands and scripts).

*If you're looking for the "old" wiki with documentation for Fabfi 3.0 or earlier, [http://wiki.fablab.af/index.php/Fab-Fi it can be found here]*
