== Welcome to the [http://fabfi.fabfolk.com FabFi] Project ==

FabFi is a free software platform deigned to enable individuals and local communities to build wireless broadband infrastructure using off-the-shelf, commodity wifi gear.  FabFi provides all the tools to:

 # Build a city-scale mesh network backbone with long and short range links
 # Provide wifi access direct to clients without CPE
 # Manage access control and bill customers by multiple methods (any day now)
 # Monitor network performance and utilization

The FabFi team also runs a network management and billing server in the cloud that network operators can use to manage and bill their networks instead of building their own server from scratch.

_NOTE: This Wiki is designed to help anyone with some computer experience to build a fabfi network.  As such, we deliberately build from base principles and provide additional explanations whenever possible.  We apologize if this is a little tedious for more advanced users._

*Navigate the system documentation using the menu on the left.*

If you're brand new to Linux (and we really suggest you use it), you might want to check out some ComputingBasics.

Want to know how everything fits together? Go to SystemArchitecture

If you want to make a Fabfi (or 100 of them) jump to HowToMake

If you're looking for troubleshooting support jump to TroubleShooting (this page also has a bunch of useful command line commands and scripts).
