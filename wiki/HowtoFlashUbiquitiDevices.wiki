Connect the device to computer via the Ethernet port. You need to use ubiquiti PoE/lAN 

Adapters and two straight-through Ethernet cables. The LAN port is connected to the

computer whereas the PoE port is connected to the device. * Hold on!; *before you insert 

the RJ45 connector into the device's port, you need to press the reset button. You can 

insert the connector while pressing the button. Hold the button down for about 15 secs. 

You will notice the lights "playing" about. You have now entered tftp mode! You may need 

to install tftp if you haven't done that already. On the terminal run the command* 

apt-get install tftp *(Debian-based OSs). Remember you neeed to be connected to the 

internet when you run the command.

Make sure the wired connection you configured before is connected.

You can now, on the terminal, run * tftp 192.168.1.20 *

then * binary *. Optionally but recommended coz it helps you confirm that what you have 

done is right: run * rexmt 1 *and* trace on *
