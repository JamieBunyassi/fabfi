This is how the system works.  The first section describes the most important things the need to happen for the system to function properly. The rest describes the gory details.  

== Required Signaling ==

There are three major components that need to talk to each other for the system to allow user connections:

  # The radius server
  # The headnode
  # The the awesome-chilli program on client access nodes.

In the system setup, The headnode must be configured with the correct IP address of the RADIUS Server.  The headnode then advertises this address at the urls: 
{{{
master.mesh
radius.mesh
map.mesh
}}}
because all the nodes forward DNS resquests to their gateway, every node will automatically resolve the above urls to the correct IP without any special configuration.  Notably, the urls above need to be listed in the 'uamallowed' option in the chilli config for each router.
