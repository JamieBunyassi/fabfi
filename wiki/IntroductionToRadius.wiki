#Freeradius Authentication, Authorization and Accounting and captive portal authentication.

= Introduction =

This article assumes that you have a working freeradius setup. For instructions on installing freeradius, go [http://code.google.com/p/fabfi/wiki/FabfiServer#Install_Freeradius here ].

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol for for carrying authentication, authorization and accounting information between a
 Network Access Server (NAS) and a shared Accounting Server.



== HOW RADIUS WORKS ==

RADIUS uses the UDP protocol to communicate between the Network Access Server (NAS) and the RADIUS server.

=== AUTHENTICATION ===

Authentication requests are listened to on port 1812

    #User connects to the Access Point (NAS) and attempts to browse to a webpage.

    #User is redirected to login splash page where he enters Username and Password

    #NAS encrypts password by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-Handshake_Authentication_Protocol CHAP]

    #RADIUS client sends username and encrypted password to the RADIUS server.

    #RADIUS server responds with Accept, Reject, or Challenge.

    #The RADIUS client acts upon services and services parameters bundled with Accept or Reject.

The Authentication Packet is a UDP packet that looks like

{{{

The radius server acts on the information contained in this packet - and responds with an ACCESS-ACCEPT or ACCESS-REJECT message.


===ACCOUNTING===

When an authentication request is successful, the UAM server immediately sends an accounting session
