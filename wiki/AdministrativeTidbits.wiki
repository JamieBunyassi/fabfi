== Introduction ==

This page contains instructions for all the administrative tasks required to manage this site.  If you learn any new processes (like how to upload images to the wiki, for instance), document them here.  

== SVN ==

Subversion (SVN) is the version control system used to track all the files on this site.  In order to modify files offline you must download them (checkout) and then upload them again (commit).  To add a new file you must add it to your local SVN copy and then commit it (add / commit).  

SVN works by making a local copy of the files on the website on your local drive 

* How to upload images to SVN *

1. Checkout Subversion: 

   $ svn checkout https://fabfi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki

2. Move to the working directory:

   $ cd wiki/

3. Make a directory in which to save images:

   $ svn mkdir images

   $ svn commit

4. Put the image under subversion control:

   $ svn add /location/filename

   $ svn commit

5. Tell subversion what mime-type to use: 

   $ svn propset svn:mime-type 'image/jpeg' /location/filename

   (Be sure to use the correct file extension e.g jpeg, png, etc)

6. Upload the image:

   $ svn copy /location/location/filename https://fabfi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images

   $ svn commit

   $ svn update

7. Refresh code.google,com/p/fabfi/wiki to check whether you did it right 

   (it will be under Source>wiki>images)
